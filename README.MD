# KeePass2-TrayTOTP

Time based One Time Password Plugin to enable 2 step authentification (supports Google and Dropbox) by generating TOTPs from the KeePass tray icon. This plugin also provides a custom column to display and/or generate TOTP's. Auto-Type is also supported when the specified custom field is used in a keystroke sequence.
This plugin requires KeePass 2.21 as it uses features that are not available in earlier versions.
